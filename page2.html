        <h1 class="p1-1"><ul><u>Dry Skin</u></ul></h1>
        <br><br><br>
        <h3 class="p1-1"><ul>If you have a more dry skintype, I would recommend using the Cerave hydrating cleanser, which contains ceramides, a lipid (fatty acid) that helps to moisturise and strengthen the protective skin moisture barrier, and hyaluronic acid. 
            <br><br>Then I would use Burt's Bees facial oil. This contains rose hip oil, wich will give your face a glowy look, essential fatty acids, and vitamins to nourish the skin and provide moisture. 
            <br><br>Lastly, I would finish off with the Aveeno Calm and Restore oat gel moizturiser. Oat gel has many benifits for your face, such as soothing dryness and nourishing the skin's natural moisture barrier.</ul></h3>

        <h1 class="p1-2"><ul><u>Acne Prone Skin</u></ul></h1>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h3 class="p1-2"><ul>If you often get pimples or breakouts on your skin, then you probably have acne prone skin. I would recommend using the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash to wash your face. This cleanser is not only oil free to prevent clogging your pores, but it also contains Salicylic Acid to help get rid of acne and help prevent future breakouts.
        <br><br>Next, I would use The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, a facial serum that, I would say, works like a miracle. I have been using it for quite some time now and it is amazing.
        <br><br>For moizturiser, I think the best one in this case, is a lighter cream like the Laneige Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer. This moisturiser prevent breakouts while also keeping the skin hydrated.</ul></h3>

        <h1 class="p1-3"><ul><u>Sensitive Skin</u></ul></h1>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h3 class="p1-3"><ul>When you have sensative skin, it can be very hard to find skincare that doesn't irritate your skin. If this is your skintype, you should try the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. It contains Panthenol and Niacinamide which both moisturize and anti-acne.
            <br><br>Many serums can be pretty harsh on the skin, so I would not recommend using one unless you have tried one that works for you.
            <br><br>As a moisturiser I would use the Aveeno Calm and Restore oat gel moisturiser because it is made completely of natural ingredients.</ul></h3>
