        <h3 class="about-me"><ul>Hi! My name is Charlotte and I go to St. Thomas High School. I decided to create this website because I have always loved skincare and since I am a swimmer, my skin is very dry, so I decided to start taking care of my skin. Ever since then, I have improved my routine and I am here to give you my advice and what to use for different skin types.</ul></h3>

        <h3 class="about-me2"><ul>My relationship with skincare has evolved so much since I started. I have tried many different things because sometimes products don't work or my skin has a bad reaction to them. I hope that I can help people figure out whichproducts are good for their skintype</ul></h3>
